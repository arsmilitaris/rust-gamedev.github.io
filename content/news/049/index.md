Welcome to the 49th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Ars Militaris

![Ars Militaris Logo](https://arsmilitaris.com/arsmilitaris_logo.png)

Ars Militaris ([GitHub](https://github.com/arsmilitaris), [Discord](https://discord.gg/cdNDQsstgq), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArsMilitarisDev)) by @arsmilitaris
is a Turn-based Tactics game set in the Ancient Rome era,
being developed with Bevy Engine.

August saw some nice developments that occurred in both the
digital and board game version of Ars Militaris. You can
read about them in issues VI through IX of This Week in Ars
Militaris ([VI](https://arsmilitaris.com/#this-week-in-ars-militaris-vi), [VII](https://arsmilitaris.com/#this-week-in-ars-militaris-vii), [VIII](https://arsmilitaris.com/#this-week-in-ars-militaris-viii), [IX](https://arsmilitaris.com/#this-week-in-ars-militaris-ix)).

The most noticeable improvements in the digital version were
the updating of the multiplayer aspect to be on par with the
single-player aspect, and then also the development of the 
[Ars Militaris Lobby](https://arsmilitaris.com/#ars-militaris-lobby).

In the board game version, development started on a new
scenario that will serve as our main product for the Ars
Militaris board game version, and much playtesting with
very positive results occurred [(Ars Militaris Event III)](https://arsmilitaris.com/#ars-militaris-event-iii)
and [(Ars Militaris Event IV)](https://arsmilitaris.com/#ars-militaris-event-iv).

But then, the result of a somewhat intensive 3-month
sprint left the Lead Developer exhausted which brought
the project to a temporary pause.
